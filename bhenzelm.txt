Example text file from my Futuresystems VM
I was able to us git clone to download the repo locally.
I can use git add to add files to the index
I can use git commit to commit changes to the local repo
I can use git push to push changes to the remote repo
I can use git pull to download any changes in the repo

A local repo is local to the device and remote is master in the repo.
